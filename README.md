===================

This is code that I demo'd in my 'Automating GUI Testing' session at the Raleigh Code Camp 2014

The WPF Application features three data entry fields for Name and two numbers. When the user hits the 'Get Magic Number'
button, the application will process the information in an On_Click event and output some data

The second project, CodedUITestProject1 is a Coded UI Test project which requires Visual Studio Ultimate or Premium. If you 
attempt to open the solution without either of these versions of Visual Studio it'll tell that the project is unavailable.

Inside the CUIT, the steps have already been recorded and has been set up to be a Data Driven test using the Data.csv file
as its data source.
